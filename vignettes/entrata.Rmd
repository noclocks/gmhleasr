## Overview

The Entrata API provides programmatic access to read and write data to the Entrata
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and it retrieves various property and marketing data,
lease and resident details, and more.

The API is organized around RPC protocols, and authenticates users by a username
and password generated through the Entrata platform. Each user is a specific
client and they can only access API for that particular company.

In order to make the API as explorable as possible, Entrata provides a "swagger-like"
experience in their documentation where you are able to view all the endpoints,
methods, parameters, examples, and even test out the API's functionality for all
read types of web-services. This functionality returns live data.

The API supports both `XML` and `JSON` format. For our use-case we will only be dealing with
JSON. The response will match the request format and should be specified in the 
`Content-Type` `HTTP` header. The URL `endpoint` depends upon the call being made.
For example, if you are making the `getCustomers` service, you would post to 
`https://[subdomain].entrata.com/api/customers`. The subdomain is client specific. 

Please note that unless stated otherwise, all dates and times used in the API are 
assumed to be in Mountain Time (MST or MDT).

## Authentication

The Entrata API uses basic authentication. The username and password are passed
in the `Authorization` header of the `HTTP` request. The username and password
are the same as the ones used to log into the Entrata platform.

To perform authentication from R, this package utilizes the `httr2` library's
`req_auth_basic()` function to pass the username and password to the API and 
handle the encoding of the credentials.

## Endpoints and Methods

The Entrata API has a number of endpoints that can be accessed. Each endpoint
has a number of methods that can be called. The methods are specific to the
endpoint and are used to perform specific actions on the data. For example, the
`properties` endpoint has methods like `getProperties`, `getPropertyUnits`,
and `sendFloorplans`.

It is important to note that *all requests made to the Entrata API are `HTTP` `POST` requests*.
This means that all requests must be made using the `POST` method, even if the
operation is a read-only (i.e. `GET`) operation. This is where the endpoint-specific
*methods* (not to be confused with `HTTP` methods) come into play. The method
is the action that you want to perform on the data. For example, if you want to
get a list of properties, you would use the `getProperties` method on the
`properties` endpoint passing it the necessary parameters specific to that 
method.

## Status Codes

Another unique aspect of the Entrata API is that it always returns a `200` status
code, regardless of the success or failure of the request. To determine if a request
was successful or not, you must inspect the response body. If the response body
contains an error message and code, then the request was not successful.

The actual `HTTP` status code associated with the error will be located in the
response body instead of the typical `HTTP` status code. The response body will
contain a `status` object with a `code` and `message` field. The `code` field
will contain the `HTTP` status code and the `message` field will contain the
message.
