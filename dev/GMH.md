These milestones and issues should provide a comprehensive roadmap for moving the project forward. They cover various aspects of the application, from code quality and new features to user experience and performance optimizations. As you progress, you may need to adjust priorities and add or remove items based on evolving project requirements and user feedback.

To implement these milestones and issues, you could use GitHub's project management features, creating milestones and issues directly in the repository. This will allow you to track progress, assign tasks, and manage the project more effectively.
